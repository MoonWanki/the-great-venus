## Synopsys

Do you know? They can get much power by acquiring more special neckless!  
Every statues wanna be strong, and your Giuliano does so!  


## Turn-based RPG game

> ***Clear stages** to grow your Guiliano and his army!*  

By clearing stages, you can get golds and experience, and increase your level.  
The higher your level is, the more powerful your characters become.


## PvP battle system
> ***Raise your rank** to earn more **ETHEREUM**!*  

That is also one reason why you must be stronger.  
You can get much stronger via investing your Ethereum to this game.  
But don't worry! If you become the ranker in leaderboard, you can get your Ethereum back!  
If you are in luck, it can be more than you invested - means that **you can earn ethereum by this game!**


## All systems are decentralized

We don't need any server for running TGV! <del>We have no server in fact.</del>  
TGV is a DApp, based on **blackchain** technology.  
so, your armies, items, and battle records will be flowing in the public blockchain network whenever and *forever*.
