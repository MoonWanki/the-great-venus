## Synopsys

The *Guiliano*'s wish is to see the *Venus*, who has *ULTIMATE Necklace*, the greatest equipment in the world.  
Do you know? They can get more power by acquiring more special necklace!  
Everyone's hope is to be strong, and so is *Guiliano*.  
That's why *Guiliano* finally decided to go on an adventure.

## Turn-based RPG game

> ***Clear stages** to grow your Guiliano and his army!*  

Clear given stages and you'll get stronger.  
In the stage, each battle is based on turn.  
If your armies are stronger than the enemy, your will win the battle. Then you can get golds and experience.  
As you experience increases, your level will rise.  
The higher your level is, the more powerful your characters become!   


## PvP battle system
> ***Raise your rank** to earn more **ETHEREUM**!*  

That is also one reason why you must be stronger.  
Optionally, you can get much stronger via investing your Ethereum to this game.  
Do you think this is the act of losing money?  
***Never!***  
If you become the ranker in leaderboard, you can get your Ethereum back!  
If you are in luck, it can be more than you invested - means that **you can earn ethereum by this game!**


## All systems are decentralized

We don't need any server for running TGV! <del>We have no server in fact.</del>  
TGV is a **DApp**(Decentralized Application) based on the **Blockchain** technology.  
Thus, all of your data, which includes armies, items, golds and battle records, will be in the public blockchain network whenever and *forever*.
